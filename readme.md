## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Geoapify API key (free at [geoapify.com](https://geoapify.com))
- Google Location History data from the NEW mobile exporter (not Google Takeout)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**:
   ```bash
   cd UAPP3
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API access**:
   Create `config/web_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "geoapify_key": "your_api_key_here",
     "last_start_date": "2024-01-01",
     "last_end_date": "2024-12-31"
   }
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python unified_app.py
   ```

5. **Open your browser**: Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## üìä Data Processing Workflow

### Input Data Requirements

**CRITICAL**: This application requires location data from Google's **NEW mobile exporter**, not Google Takeout. The mobile export provides cleaner, more structured data.

### Supported File Types

1. **Raw Google JSON**: Direct export from Google mobile app
2. **Pre-processed JSON**: Files cleaned by companion preprocessing tools
3. **Master Files**: Large, unparsed location history files

### Processing Pipeline

1. **File Upload**: Users upload location history files via web interface
2. **Data Validation**: System validates file format and structure
3. **Intelligent Processing**: 
   - Detects if file needs preprocessing
   - Applies noise filtering for GPS accuracy
   - Performs geocoding with smart caching
4. **Analysis Generation**:
   - Time spent by location analysis
   - Movement pattern detection
   - Distance calculations
   - City and country identification
5. **Export Generation**: Multiple output formats for different use cases

## üóÇÔ∏è File Management System

### User File Organization

Each user gets dedicated directories:
- `uploads/[username]/` - Original uploaded files
- `processed/[username]/` - Cleaned and processed files
- `outputs/[username]/` - Generated analysis reports

### Master File Handling

- **Storage**: Master files (large unparsed files) are stored on disk
- **Naming Convention**: `MASTER_xxxx.json` for easy identification
- **Cache Management**: Browser cache used for active sessions only
- **Disk vs Cache**: Processed files available in both locations for optimal performance

## üìà Analysis Outputs

### Generated Reports

1. **city_jumps.csv**: Movement between cities with distances and timing
2. **by_city_location_days.csv**: Time spent in each city with detailed breakdown
3. **by_state_location_days.csv**: Time spent by state/country
4. **analysis_summary.txt**: Executive summary with key insights and top destinations

### Real-Time Analytics

- **Progress Indicators**: Live updates during processing
- **Processing Statistics**: Data points processed, cache hit rates
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed feedback on any processing issues

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### User Settings

- **Date Range Selection**: Analyze specific time periods
- **Processing Preferences**: Choose between speed and accuracy
- **Output Formats**: Select desired export formats
- **API Usage Limits**: Configure geocoding API usage

### Advanced Configuration

- **Cache Management**: Control cache size and retention
- **Batch Processing**: Configure processing batch sizes
- **Error Handling**: Set retry limits and timeout values

## üîß Technical Details

## üêõ Known Issues & Solutions

### Current Issues (September 2025)

1. **File Size Discrepancy**: 
   - **Issue**: Master file shows different sizes in browser cache (36.5MB) vs disk (52.9MB)
   - **Status**: Under investigation
   - **Workaround**: Use disk-based files for accurate size reporting

2. **JavaScript Control Popup**:
   - **Issue**: Unwanted "Saved Location Data" popup appears sporadically after analysis
   - **Status**: Debugging in progress
   - **Action Needed**: Identify trigger and remove control

3. **Remove Button Functionality**:
   - **Issue**: 'Remove' button in Master File box is non-functional
   - **Expected**: Should delete the master file
